  <!-- Book Excerpts -->
  <h2><strong>Pride and Prejudice</strong></h2>
  <p>
    It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want 
    of a wife. However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a 
    neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered 
    as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.
  </p>

  <h2><strong>Moby-Dick</strong></h2>
  <p>
    Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money in my purse, and 
    nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part 
    of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
  </p>

  <h2><strong>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</strong></h2>
  <p>
    To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his 
    eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love 
    for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably 
    balanced mind.
